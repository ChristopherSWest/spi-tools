    """Profile some callable.

    This decorator uses the hotshot profiler to profile some callable (like
    a view function or method) and dumps the profile data somewhere sensible
    for later processing and examination.

    It takes one argument, the profile log name. If it's a relative path, it
    places it under the PROFILE_LOG_BASE. It also inserts a time stamp into the
    file name, such that 'my_view.prof' become 'my_view-20100211T170321.prof',
    where the time stamp is in UTC. This makes it easy to run and compare
    multiple trials.
