Note that I think this is a firm of one or two people (consistent with Bbb23's results), but that the possibility does exist that this is the same person and there is more technical evidence tying the two groups than there was last time. I'm fine calling it the same sockfarm, however.

The following are {{confirmed}} to Group 2 from last time:
*{{checkuser|Viktorison}}
*{{checkuser|Bodiadub}}
*{{checkuser|Krankich}}
*{{checkuser|Stolls}}
*{{checkuser|Veronica Zadernivska}}
The following accounts are {{possilikely}} to the above, but I've gone ahead and blocked because of the clear spamming and autoconfirmed gaming:
*{{checkuser|Nazar2263}}
*{{checkuser|XeRays}}
The following accounts are {{confirmed}} to one another and Group 1 from last time and I'd say {{possilikely}} to first group here:
*{{checkuser|Molisone}}
*{{checkuser|Kentarzi}}
*{{checkuser|CryBite}}
My suspicion is that this is a marketing firm or a bunch of freelancers working together, but putting it all under one case going forward makes sense. All {{bwt}}. {{Clerk Request}} Would a clerk move to Bodiadub? As that is the apparent oldest account and this has xwiki implications. Don't worry about the tagging. Thanks for your help :) [[User:TonyBallioni|TonyBallioni]] ([[User talk:TonyBallioni|talk]]) 04:05, 22 May 2019 (UTC)
:Thanks. Deleted everything I could under G5. I see that Bodiadub is blocked on the Russian Wikipedia for UPE, so this is likely a candidate for locking. [[User:MER-C|MER-C]] 10:47, 22 May 2019 (UTC)
::I notified the global checkuser-l email list last night, and uk.wiki cus are aware of this and will be looking at it. [[User:TonyBallioni|TonyBallioni]] ([[User talk:TonyBallioni|talk]]) 12:25, 22 May 2019 (UTC)

*Noting for future reference: based on evidence from uk.wiki CUs, the Crazyalien and Bodiadub do appear to be different people, but that they are working in concert is highly likely. I don't see a reason for us to have two different cases on this at en.wiki, and they all should be reported here.

* {{bnt}} per the repost after blatantly gaming autoconfirmed. Leaving open for any possible check for sleepers of this UPE sockfarm. [[User:ST47|ST47]] ([[User talk:ST47|talk]]) 17:32, 13 July 2019 (UTC)
